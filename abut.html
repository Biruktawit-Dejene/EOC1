    The Ethiopian Orators' Contest serves as a dynamic platform that celebrates the art of public speaking and logical debate among the youth of Ethiopia. Participants, typically students from diverse backgrounds, immerse themselves in a competitive atmosphere where they deliver compelling speeches and engage in debates on a wide range of topics. This experience allows them to showcase their oratory skills, creativity, and ability to captivate an audience.

In addition to the oratory performances, the contest features a debate segment that encourages participants to engage in structured discussions on pressing societal issues. This component not only sharpens their critical thinking and reasoning abilities but also teaches them how to articulate and defend their viewpoints effectively.

The contest emphasizes the significance of effective communication while fostering cultural exchange and a deep appreciation for Ethiopia's rich tradition. Its primary goal is to empower young individuals by enhancing their public speaking capabilities, critical thinking skills, and persuasive communication techniques. Participants gain invaluable experience in expressing their thoughts clearly and confidently, all while receiving constructive feedback from assigned judges.

Each contest round will last for 2 months, and each round will consist of students aged between 15 and 20. Though the session is primarily focused on speaking and argumentation, we will be inviting experts on leadership and business ideas and will try to organize contests on relevant topics. The contest will have two sessions, and each session will be held differently. Both sessions will be held online each week.

<h1><center><font color ='green'>The Debate Contest</font></center></h1>
<p font style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif ; font-size: 100%;font-weight: bold;">The debate contest is organized with the aim of creating logical arguers who can be the best fit for different fields in their lives by explaining their ideas convincingly, logically, and confidently. Besides, it is a great session for cultivating future top arguers for their country on international stages. As mentioned earlier, this contest is for youths aged between 15 and 20. Thus, it would be a great step toward building logical, open-minded, and confident citizens who can argue and oppose effectively in the future.

The debate contest will be held online, and youths will be organized into teams. Each team will have four members, and for the first contest, each team will be assigned a student advisor. Each team should discuss and send their files to their advisors, and their ideas will be evaluated based on some criteria and given feedback before the contest. After the first contest, each team will be compelled to work completely by themselves.
The contest will be held every Thursday.

This session won't be solely a competition; we will also have training days led by different experts, including foreign individuals.

    <p font style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif ; font-size: 100%;font-weight: bold;" > Team Structure: Each participating team consists of members who tackle specific topics throughout the contest. Teams are encouraged to adapt to different debate formats, helping them develop a diverse skill set.

 - Debate Formats: The contest will feature three globally recognized formats: <br>
 <li>World Schools Traditional Debate Format</li>
 <li>British Parliamentary Debate Format</li> 
 <li>Lincoln-Douglas Debate Format</li> <br>
 
Initially, our first contest sessions will be held by the World Schools Traditional Debate format; thereafter, the remaining formats will be introduced to the contestants after these sessions.
<br>
 World Schools Traditional Debate Format
This format includes two opposing teams: the Proposition (supporting the motion) and the Opposition (against the motion). Each team comprises three speakers.
<br>
<br>
 <center>First Speakers</center> <br>

  Proposition's First Speaker: <br>

 1. Define the Motion: <br>
 - Articulate a clear interpretation of the motion (the debate topic). <br>
 - Set the boundaries of the debate, ensuring both teams understand the terms. <br>

 2. Outline the Proposition's Case:   <br>
 - Present the main arguments that the team will use to support the motion. <br>
 - Clearly indicate how these arguments relate to the motion at hand.            <br>
 
 3. Speaker Breakdown <br>
 - Assign specific roles to each team member, indicating who will address which parts of the case. <br>
 - Inform both judges and the opposing team about the responsibilities of each speaker. <br>

4. Initial Arguments: <br>
 - Present the foundational argument that will serve as the cornerstone for the team’s case.  <br>
 - Ensure that this argument is directly relevant to the motion. <br>
 <br>
 Opposition's First Speaker: <br>

 1. Challenge the Definition (Only if the oppose believes that the motion is misinterpreted): <br>
 - Decide whether to accept or refute the Proposition’s definition. <br>
 - If refuting, provide a balanced alternative definition to avoid ambiguity.    <br>
 
 2. Outline the Opposition Case: <br>
 - Summarize the key arguments that will be used to counter the motion. <br>
 - Detail how these arguments will contest the Proposition's case.           <br>
 
 3. Speaker Breakdown:        <br>
 - Clearly indicate which team members will address specific arguments raised by the Proposition. <br>
 
 4. Refutation of the First Proposition:      <br>
 - Directly respond to the initial arguments presented by the Proposition.   <br>
 - This is crucial for demonstrating the depth of research and preparation.      <br>


 5. Preliminary Arguments: <br>
 - Articulate the initial arguments the Opposition will use to contest the motion.  <br>
 - These arguments should be well-thought-out and relevant.     <br>
         <br>
         <br>

<center>Second Speakers </center>
 - Proposition's Second Speaker: <br>
 1. Defend the Definition:   <br>
 - If under attack, explain why the Proposition’s definition remains valid and suitable for the debate. <br>
 
 2. Continue Reasoning: <br>
 - Introduce additional arguments not previously presented by the first speaker. <br>
 - Ensure these arguments support the overall strategy of the team.        <br>
 
 3. Defend Previous Arguments:          <br>
 - Counter the Opposition's rebuttals to the Proposition's initial arguments. <br>
 - This reinforces the strength of the Proposition’s case. <br>
 
 4. Offer Rebuttal to the Opposition's Case:       <br>
 - Identify and explain the gaps or errors in the Opposition's arguments. <br>
 - Provide clear reasons why these gaps undermine the Opposition's position.    <br>

 <center>Third Speakers ( Opposition and Proposition)</center> <br>
 
 ‎The third speaker focuses on defending and deepening the case, rebutting arguments from the opponent team, and providing additional supporting information. New arguments are not introduced at this stage.
 ‎
 ‎ <br><center>Reply Speeches (Opposition and Proposition) <br>
 ‎</center>
 ‎The reply speech summarizes the key arguments, refutes the opponents arguments, and offers a final concluding statement. This speech is delivered by either the first or second speaker. Third speaker is not allowed to make a reply speech.
<br> <br>Points of Information (POIs) <br>- Definition: Points of Information (POIs) are interjections made by members of the opposing 
team during a speech. They allow the opposing team to ask questions or make brief statements to 
challenge or clarify points made by the speaker. <br> - Purpose: POIs serve several functions: <br>- Engagement: They encourage interaction between the teams, fostering a dynamic debate 
atmosphere. <br> - Challenge: POIs provide an opportunity for the opposing team to challenge the arguments 
presented, promoting critical thinking. <br>- Clarification: They allow for clarification of points that may be ambiguous or poorly 
articulated. <br> - When to Offer POIs: POIs can be offered during the 2nd to 7th minutes of main speeches, but 
not during the first and last minutes or in reply speeches. Each speaker is encouraged to accept 1
2 POIs to maintain flow and engagement. 
<br>
- Judging POIs: Judges may adjust scores based on the quality of POIs offered and how 
effectively they are responded to. Strong POIs can enhance a team's evaluation, while poorly 
handled ones may detract from performance.  <br> <br>
